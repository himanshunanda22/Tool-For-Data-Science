# Hey this is Himanshu Nanda,
# I am interested in Data Science because I would love to contribute towards machine learning models particulary optimmizing the hyperparamters in the future

# ### Data Science Languages
# 
# 1. **Python**: Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science, known for its simplicity and extensive libraries like NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
# 
# 2. **R**: R is a specialized language designed for statistical analysis and data visualization, widely used in data science and research.
# 
# 3. **SQL**: SQL (Structured Query Language) is essential for working with relational databases and managing large datasets in data science projects.
# 
# 4. **Julia**: Julia is a high-performance programming language designed for scientific computing and data analysis, known for its speed and versatility.
# 
# 5. **SAS**: SAS (Statistical Analysis System) is a software suite commonly used for advanced analytics, data management, and business intelligence.
# 
# 6. **Scala**: Scala is a language that combines functional and object-oriented programming and is often used in big data processing with Apache Spark.
# 
# 7. **Java**: Java is used in data science, particularly for big data projects, machine learning, and developing applications.
# 
# 8. **MATLAB**: MATLAB is a high-level language used in engineering and scientific computing, including data analysis and visualization.

# ### Data Science Libraries (Python)
# 
# 1. **NumPy**: NumPy is a fundamental library for numerical computing in Python. It provides support for working with arrays and matrices, essential for scientific and mathematical calculations.
# 
# 2. **pandas**: pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It offers data structures like DataFrames and Series, making it easy to work with structured data.
#

# 
# 6. **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google. It's commonly used for deep learning applications.
# 
# 7. **PyTorch**: PyTorch is another deep learning framework with dynamic computation graphs, often preferred by researchers and developers for its flexibility.
# 
# 8. **Keras**: Keras is an easy-to-use high-level neural networks API that can run on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.
# 
# 9. **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: NLTK is a library for natural language processing and text analysis in Python.
# 
# 10. **OpenCV**: OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is used for computer vision tasks such as image and video processing.
# 
# 11. **statsmodels**: statsmodels is a library for estimating and interpreting statistical models.
